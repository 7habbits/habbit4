    <p class="headline">The Habit of Mutual Benefit</p>
    <div class="text1">
      <p>
        Think Win-Win isn’t about being nice, nor is it a quick-fix technique.
        It is a character-based code for human interaction and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of us learn to base our self-worth on comparisons and competition.
        We think about succeeding in terms of someone else failing—if I win, you
        lose; or if you win, I lose. Life becomes a zero-sum game. There is only
        so much pie to go around, and if you get a big piece, there is less for
        me; it’s not fair, and I’m going to make sure you don’t get anymore. We
        all play the game, but how much fun is it really?
      </p>

      <p>
        Win-win sees life as a cooperative arena, not a competitive one. Win-win
        is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all
        human interactions. Win-win means agreements or solutions are mutually
        beneficial and satisfying. We both get to eat the pie, and it tastes
        pretty darn good!
      </p>

      <p>
        To go for win-win, you not only have to be empathic, but you also have
        to be confident. You not only have to be considerate and sensitive, but
        you also have to be brave. That balance between courage and
        consideration is the essence of real maturity and is fundamental to
        win-win.

      <p class="headline2">Why Win-Win?</p>

      <p class="text2">
        Many people think in terms of either/or: either you’re nice or you’re
        tough. Win-win requires that you be both. It is a balancing act between
        courage and consideration.
      </p>

      <p class="text2">
        There are three vital character traits that are essential to this
        paradigm:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Integrity: sticking with your true feelings, values, and commitments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maturity: expressing your ideas and feelings with courage and
          consideration for the ideas and feelings of others.
        </li>
        <li>Abundance Mentality: believing there is plenty for everyone.</li>

        “If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important
        principle I have learned in the field of interpersonal relations, it
        would be this: Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”
